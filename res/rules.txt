How to play the dice game

The goal of this game is to be the last player with points.
Players start with 30 points, everyone rolls to see who goes first, highest number goes first.

Players take turns rolling 6 dice with the goal of getting the highest possible roll.
On each roll you have to keep at least one die but can keep as many dice as you have rolled.
You have to roll at least 30 to keep your points.

Every point below 30 that you roll gets deducted off of your score (E.G. if you roll a total of 23 you lose 7 points).

If you roll 30 exactly you keep your points and it is the next player's turn.

If you roll over 30, collect your dice and roll them again to take points away from the previous player with points.
In this round of rolling you keep dice with faces equal to your points over 30 (E.G. if you rolled 35 you keep your 5's on this round of rolling).
As long as you roll a new face of your number you can keep rolling your remaining dice.
Once you cannot roll anymore you count up the amount of points that you scored and that gets deducted from the previous player's score.
(E.G. if you rolled 35 and collected 5's and on your next round rolled 3 5's then no 5's deduct 15 points from the previous player).
